👋 Hi, I'm Hashim! As a software developer, I'm driven by the power of technology to create positive change in our society. My journey in tech has always been guided by the potential for meaningful social impact.

👀 Interests: Beyond the code, I'm fascinated by [Artificial Intelligence and its applications in healthcare], [Augmented Reality in education], and [sustainable tech solutions for environmental challenges].
